1,Circular bloodstain with smooth edges,Victim was stationary when the blood dropped; blood fell vertically at 90 degrees.
2,Elliptical bloodstain with pointed end,Blood hit the surface at an angle; indicates direction of movement of bleeding person or weapon.
3,Multiple small circular blood drops forming a trail,Victim was walking or moving slowly while bleeding; trail shows direction of movement.
4,Blood spatter in a radiating pattern from a single point,"High-velocity impact (e.g., gunshot) or arterial spray; origin is at the center of the pattern."
5,Cast-off bloodstains forming arcs,Weapon was swung and flung blood; arcs indicate motion and number of swings.
6,Bloodstain with spikes or protrusions on the edge,Blood hit surface with greater force or irregularities; indicates movement or textured impact surface.
7,Blood smeared in a single direction,Victim or object moved through the blood; direction of smear shows movement.
8,Voids or clean areas within a blood spatter,Object or person blocked the path of the blood; may indicate presence and position at time of spatter.
9,Diluted or light-colored bloodstain,Blood was exposed to water or another liquid; may indicate cleanup attempt or environmental exposure.
10,Saturated blood pool with no trail,Victim was immobile for an extended time at that location; may indicate point of collapse or death.
11,Projected blood in upward direction on walls or ceiling,"Indicates forceful upward projection, likely from arterial spray or explosive injury."
12,Blood transfer pattern shaped like a hand or footprint,A bloody hand or foot contacted the surface; provides direction and movement of person.
13,Multiple overlapping stains of different sizes,Indicates multiple impacts or stages of events; may show struggle or prolonged violence.
14,Blood found on ceiling in small droplets,Arterial spray or high-velocity spatter from upward injury or gunshot.
15,Drip stain leading to a void and continued trail,"Person stopped momentarily, possibly paused or changed direction."
16,A whorl fingerprint pattern is found in about 30% of people.,Whorl patterns contain circular or spiral characteristics which are genetically inherited.
17,Latent prints are invisible to the naked eye but can be revealed using powders.,Oils and sweat residues left behind can be adhered to using fine fingerprint powders.
18,Loop patterns are the most common fingerprint type.,"Loop prints enter from one side, curve around, and exit the same side."
19,Gunshot residue on a suspect's hand indicates they recently fired a weapon.,Discharge from firearms leaves particulate residues on skin or clothing.
20,Entry wounds are typically smaller and more circular than exit wounds.,"Bullets push tissue outward upon exit, creating larger openings."
21,Rifling marks on a bullet can match it to a specific firearm.,Grooves and lands inside the barrel leave unique striations on bullets.
22,Mitochondrial DNA is useful in identifying remains when nuclear DNA is degraded.,It is inherited maternally and remains intact in old or damaged samples.
23,Touch DNA can be collected from objects handled by a suspect.,Skin cells shed naturally and can be left behind on surfaces.
24,DNA evidence can exonerate the wrongly accused.,Unique genetic profiles provide strong evidence of presence or absence.
25,Deleted files can often be recovered from digital devices.,Data is not always erased immediately and can remain in memory sectors.
26,IP addresses can help trace the origin of online activity.,Every connected device has a unique address assigned by the network.
27,"Metadata in photos can reveal time, date, and GPS location.",Digital cameras embed data in image files that can be used as evidence.
28,High levels of carbon monoxide in blood suggest death by inhalation.,"CO binds with hemoglobin more effectively than oxygen, leading to suffocation."
29,Presence of ethanol and metabolites indicates alcohol consumption.,Ethanol is metabolized in the liver producing recognizable byproducts.
30,A bluish discoloration under nails may suggest cyanide poisoning.,"Cyanide disrupts cellular respiration, leading to oxygen deprivation."
31,Paint chips can be used to identify hit-and-run vehicles.,Automotive paints have layered compositions traceable to manufacturers.
32,Fibers on a victim's body can connect them to a location or suspect.,Microscopic examination of weave patterns and material types aids identification.
33,Glass fragments can show direction of impact.,Radial and concentric fracture patterns indicate force direction.
